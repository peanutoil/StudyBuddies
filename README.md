# StudyBuddies
If you're someone who is most productive at group study sessions, this is the product for you! StudyBuddies lets users post information about Study Sessions to a collgee-wide feed and let's other user's sign up for your group. This way, you can always find people to study with you! This website features a login and registration system, the ability to upload and view posts containing key information about your study session (ex: capacity, subject, location), and allows you to search for study sessions based on different criteria. 

Future features include: SSO authentication (for NYU or other schools for login), further advanced search systems, and an improved UI/UX (perhaps in the format of a mobile app as well).
